This page collects frequent questions from teams adopting anssl. If you need deeper assistance, reach out to support at any time.

## Essentials

### Is anssl free?

Yes. Core features are free forever, including:

- Unlimited certificate issuance  
- Automated renewals  
- Domain monitoring  
- Basic automated deployment

anssl integrates with free DV CAs such as Let's Encrypt, ZeroSSL, and Google Trust Services.

### How is anssl different from other tools?

**Compared to Certbot**

- Visual web console—no command line required.  
- Centralized management for multiple servers.  
- Built-in monitoring and renewal alerts.  
- Automated deployment across diverse platforms.

**Compared to issuing directly via a CA**

- Higher automation with scheduled renewals.  
- Unified inventory for many domains.  
- Batch operations for large fleets.  
- A friendlier workflow for teams.

## Issuing certificates

### How long does issuance take?

Most certificates issue within 1–5 minutes. Timing depends on:

- Validation method (DNS requires propagation).  
- The CA’s processing queue.  
- Your network latency.

### How many certificates can I request?

There’s no platform-level limit. Issue as many certificates as you need.

### What should I do if issuance fails?

Common causes:

1. **Validation failed** — Confirm DNS or HTTP challenge data matches the instructions.  
2. **DNS propagation delay** — Wait 5–30 minutes and retry.  
3. **Domain unreachable** — Ensure the hostname resolves correctly.  
4. **CA rate limits** — Wait for the cooling period or switch to another CA.  
5. **Invalid domain** — Verify the hostname format is supported.

See the certificate detail page for full error logs.

## Domain validation

### Which validation method should I use?

**DNS validation (recommended)**

- ✅ Works for every certificate type  
- ✅ Supports wildcard certificates  
- ✅ Requires no open HTTP port  
- ❌ Depends on DNS propagation time

**HTTP validation**

- ✅ Faster verification  
- ✅ Simple for existing web servers  
- ❌ No wildcard support  
- ❌ Requires port 80 availability

## Renewals

### When does automatic renewal run?

With auto-renew enabled, anssl starts renewal attempts 20 days before expiry and retries daily until success. If automated deployment is configured, new certificates roll out immediately.

### What if auto-renew fails?

You’ll receive email notifications when renewals fail. Typical issues include:

1. **Validation errors** — Ensure DNS/HTTP challenges still exist.  
2. **Expired domains** — Renew the domain registration.  
3. **CA outages** — Retry with an alternate CA if available.  
4. **Rate limits** — Pause and retry after the limit resets.

Check the renewal history and error logs on the certificate detail page, or trigger a manual renewal once the issue is resolved.

### Can I renew manually?

Yes. Click **Renew now** on the certificate detail page to start the process immediately. Avoid doing this excessively to prevent CA rate limits.

### Do I need to redeploy after renewal?

- **Automatic deployment enabled** — No action required. anssl handles the rollout.  
- **Manual deployment** — Download the new files and update your servers.

We recommend enabling automated deployment to close the loop.

## Technical details

### Does anssl support ACME v2?

Yes. anssl implements the ACME v2 protocol and works with any compatible CA.

### Is there an API?

Yes. The REST API lets you:

- Request certificates  
- Check status  
- Download issued files  
- Manage deployment targets  
- Configure domain monitoring

Visit **Developer Center** in the console for full documentation.

## Additional topics

### Can I use these certificates on internal networks?

Public CAs such as Let's Encrypt issue certificates only for publicly resolvable domains. For internal use:

- **Public domain with internal resolution** — Works when you can complete DNS validation.  
- **Private-only domains** — Use a private CA or self-signed certificates.

### Can I request a certificate for an IP address?

Free CAs do not currently issue certificates for bare IP addresses.

### Can I move certificates to other platforms?

Absolutely. Certificates are issued in standard formats and work on any TLS-capable platform—you’re never locked in.
