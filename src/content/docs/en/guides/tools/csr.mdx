A certificate signing request (CSR) packages your public key, domain information, and organization data so a certificate authority can issue an SSL certificate. anssl’s CSR tool helps you create standards-compliant CSRs together with matching private keys in just a few clicks.

## What is a CSR?

A CSR is a structured text file containing:

- **Domain details** — The hostname or wildcard you plan to secure.
- **Organization fields** — Company name, department, and location information.
- **Public key** — The public half of the key pair that will anchor your certificate.
- **Signing algorithm** — RSA or ECC, which determines key length and compatibility.

You submit the CSR to a CA; after validation, the CA signs it and returns the certificate.

<Aside type="note">
  Creating a CSR also generates a private key. Store it securely and never share it with anyone.
</Aside>

## Use the anssl CSR tool

<Steps>

1. **Open the tool**  
   Visit the [CSR generator](https://anssl.cn/console/tools/csr).

2. **Enter domain information**  
   - **Common Name (CN)** — Primary domain such as `example.com` or `*.example.com`.  
   - **Subject Alternative Names (SANs)** — Optional list of additional hostnames.

3. **Provide organization details**  
   - **Organization (O)** — Legal entity name.  
   - **Organizational Unit (OU)** — Department (optional).  
   - **Country (C)** — ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 code (`CN`, `US`, etc.).  
   - **State/Province (ST)** — Full region name.  
   - **Locality (L)** — City name.

4. **Choose a signing algorithm**  
   - **RSA-2048 / 3072 / 4096** — Maximizes compatibility at increasing security levels.  
   - **ECC P-256 / P-384** — Recommended for modern workloads thanks to smaller keys and faster handshakes.

5. **Generate**  
   Click **Generate** to produce the CSR (submit to the CA) and a matching private key.

6. **Download immediately**  
   Save both files locally. The private key is shown only once.

</Steps>

<Aside type="danger">
  **Important:** If you misplace the private key, you must generate a new CSR and reissue the certificate.
</Aside>

## Field reference

### Common Name (CN)

Defines the primary domain covered by the certificate:

- **Single domain** — `example.com` or `www.example.com`.  
- **Wildcard** — `*.example.com` to include every subdomain.

<Aside type="caution">
  CN holds only one value. Use SAN entries to cover additional hostnames.
</Aside>

### Subject Alternative Names (SAN)

Protect multiple domains by adding one entry per line:

```
example.com
www.example.com
blog.example.com
shop.example.com
```

### Organization details

Provide accurate information for OV/EV certificates:

- **Organization (O)** — Legal business name.  
- **Organizational Unit (OU)** — Department, e.g., “IT Department” (optional).  
- **Country (C)** — Two-letter country code.  
- **State/Province (ST)** — Full region name.  
- **Locality (L)** — Full city name.

Example:

```
O = Example Inc.
OU = IT Department
C = CN
ST = Beijing
L = Beijing
```

<Aside type="tip">
  DV certificates do not validate organization data, but OV/EV issuances will, so accuracy matters.
</Aside>

## Selecting an algorithm

### RSA

- **Pros:** Universal compatibility; well-understood by every browser and appliance.  
- **Cons:** Larger keys (2048–4096 bits) generate more CPU and bandwidth overhead.

Use RSA when legacy device support is a strict requirement.

### ECC (recommended)

- **Pros:** Short keys with equivalent security, faster handshakes, smaller certificates.  
- **Cons:** A small number of legacy systems may lack ECC support.

Choose ECC for modern web, mobile, and high-throughput workloads.

### Comparison

| Algorithm   | Key length | Equivalent security | Performance | Compatibility |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| RSA-2048    | 2048 bits  | Baseline            | ★★★☆☆      | ★★★★★         |
| RSA-3072    | 3072 bits  | High                | ★★☆☆☆      | ★★★★★         |
| RSA-4096    | 4096 bits  | Very high           | ★☆☆☆☆      | ★★★★★         |
| ECC P-256   | 256 bits   | ≈ RSA-3072          | ★★★★★      | ★★★★☆         |
| ECC P-384   | 384 bits   | ≈ RSA-7680          | ★★★★☆      | ★★★★☆         |

<Aside type="tip">
  ECC P-256 offers the best balance of performance and security for most deployments.
</Aside>

### Private key example

<Aside type="danger">
  Private keys are sensitive—never commit them to Git, send them over email, or store them on unsecured devices.
</Aside>

## Verify your CSR

Run the built-in validator or use OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl req -text -noout -verify -in example.csr
```

`verify OK` indicates the CSR structure is valid. Review the output to confirm:

- ✅ Domains and SANs are correct.  
- ✅ Organization data matches your records.  
- ✅ The signing algorithm is what you expect.  
- ✅ The public key length is correct.

## Use the CSR for issuance

### Option A: anssl-managed issuance

When you request certificates through anssl, the platform can handle CSR creation automatically—you don’t need to supply your own file.

### Option B: External CAs

For third-party issuances:

1. Paste the CSR into the CA’s request form.  
2. Complete the required domain validation steps.  
3. Download the issued certificate.  
4. Deploy the certificate alongside the saved private key.

<Aside type="caution">
  Always pair certificates with the correct private key. A mismatch will break the TLS handshake.
</Aside>

## Generate a CSR with OpenSSL

Prefer the CLI? These snippets show how to recreate the same results manually.

### RSA example

```bash
# Generate private key and CSR in one step
openssl req -new -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes \
  -keyout example.com.key \
  -out example.com.csr \
  -subj "/C=CN/ST=Beijing/L=Beijing/O=Example Inc/CN=example.com"
```

### ECC example

```bash
# Generate ECC private key
openssl ecparam -genkey -name prime256v1 -out example.com.key

# Create CSR
openssl req -new -key example.com.key \
  -out example.com.csr \
  -subj "/C=CN/ST=Beijing/L=Beijing/O=Example Inc/CN=example.com"
```

### Add SAN entries

Create `san.cnf`:

```ini
[req]
distinguished_name = req_distinguished_name
req_extensions = v3_req

[req_distinguished_name]
countryName = Country Name
stateOrProvinceName = State or Province Name
localityName = Locality Name
organizationName = Organization Name
commonName = Common Name

[v3_req]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[alt_names]
DNS.1 = example.com
DNS.2 = www.example.com
DNS.3 = blog.example.com
```

Generate the CSR with SANs:

```bash
openssl req -new -key example.com.key \
  -out example.com.csr \
  -config san.cnf \
  -subj "/C=CN/ST=Beijing/L=Beijing/O=Example Inc/CN=example.com"
```

## Frequently asked questions

### What if I lose the CSR or private key?

If the private key is lost, the existing certificate is unusable. Generate a new CSR/key pair and reissue the certificate.

<Aside type="tip">
  Encrypt private keys and back them up in a secure vault or password manager.
</Aside>

### Can I reuse the same CSR multiple times?

It’s technically possible but not recommended. Generate fresh CSRs and keys for each issuance to reduce risk and simplify audits.

### Can I edit organization fields after generating the CSR?

No. If you need different details, create a new CSR. (DV certificates ignore organization data, but OV/EV requests require accuracy.)
