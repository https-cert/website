WHOIS is the protocol registrars use to publish domain ownership and lifecycle information. anssl’s WHOIS tool surfaces registrar data, expiry dates, name servers, and status codes in seconds.

## Run a WHOIS search

Open the [WHOIS tool](https://anssl.cn/console/tools/whois) and:

1. Enter the domain (for example `example.com`).  
2. Click **Search**.  
3. Review the returned record.

## Interpreting the output

### Domain basics

```
Domain Name: example.com
Registrar: GoDaddy.com, LLC
Registrar IANA ID: 146
Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.godaddy.com
Registrar URL: https://www.godaddy.com
```

### Key dates

```
Created: 1995-08-14T04:00:00Z
Updated: 2024-08-13T09:22:45Z
Expires: 2025-08-13T04:00:00Z
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Treat the expiry date as a hard deadline—renew at least 30 days ahead to avoid redemption fees or accidental loss.
</Aside>

### Registrant details

GDPR and registrar privacy services often redact sensitive data, resulting in outputs such as:

```
Registrant Organization: Privacy Protected
Registrant Country: IS
```

### Name servers

```
Name Server:
- ns1.example.com
- ns2.example.com
```

### Domain status codes

Common codes include:

- **clientTransferProhibited** — Locked against unauthorized transfers.  
- **clientUpdateProhibited** — Locked to prevent contact updates.  
- **clientDeleteProhibited** — Protected from accidental deletion.  
- **clientRenewProhibited** — Renewal temporarily blocked.  
- **clientHold** — DNS service suspended (often billing or policy related).  
- **pendingDelete** — Domain is scheduled for deletion.  
- **redemptionPeriod** — Grace period after expiry when the owner can still reclaim the domain.

<Aside type="caution">
  `clientHold`, `pendingDelete`, or `redemptionPeriod` require immediate attention before the domain becomes publicly available.

## When to use WHOIS

### 1. Confirm domain ownership

Before purchasing or inheriting a project, check:

- Registrar and registrant details.  
- Domain age (creation date).  
- Expiry and renewal history.  
- Whether the domain is active or restricted.

### 2. Track expiry milestones

Periodically review critical domains:

- Prevent accidental expiration.  
- Budget for renewals.  
- Avoid losing strategic names to opportunistic buyers.

### 3. Troubleshoot DNS issues

If a site goes offline, WHOIS helps you verify:

- Correct name server assignment.  
- Lock or hold statuses preventing updates.  
- Whether the domain has expired.

## Pairing WHOIS with certificate management

### Pre-issuance checks

Before requesting an SSL certificate:

- Confirm the domain is registered and valid.  
- Ensure the correct DNS provider is set so you can update records.  
- Verify no registrar locks will block ACME validation.

## Privacy considerations

Due to GDPR and local privacy laws:

- Many registrants opt for privacy services.  
- Some TLDs redact almost all contact data.  
- You may need to reach out to the registrar for additional details.

<Aside type="note">
  ICANN requires registrars to expose WHOIS data, but the exact fields vary by registry policy. Expect different output between TLDs.

## Best practices

### Audit key domains regularly

Review high-value domains each quarter:

- Corporate primary domains  
- Brand-protection domains  
- Core application domains

### Maintain an asset inventory

Track:

- Every domain you own  
- Registrar details  
- Creation and expiry dates  
- Business purpose and owner  
- Renewal status and notes

### Configure reminders

- Set reminders 90, 30, and 7 days before expiry.  
- Use anssl’s monitoring feature to automate alerts and reporting.

<Aside type="tip">
  Enable auto-renewal for mission-critical domains to avoid surprises.
