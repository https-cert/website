anssl automates certificate rollouts so freshly issued files reach your infrastructure as soon as theyâ€™re available. Use the deployment agent for traditional servers or integrate with built-in cloud connectors.

## Configure automated deployment

<Steps>

1. **Open the deployment console**

   Visit the [Automatic deployment](https://anssl.cn/console/deploy) page in anssl.

2. **Install the deployment CLI**

   Download the agent for your platform and follow the installation instructions provided on the page.

3. **Select the certificate**

   Choose the certificate that should be synchronized to your target environment.

4. **Configure targets**

   Add one or more destinations (SSH servers, load balancers, or cloud providers) and specify deployment commands or API credentials.

5. **Run a test deployment**

   Trigger a dry run to confirm connectivity and permissions before turning on automation.

6. **Enable continuous deployment**

   Activate the schedule so anssl pushes renewed certificates immediately after issuance.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  Combine automated deployment with monitoring alerts to ensure every critical endpoint receives updates before certificates expire.

## Troubleshooting

- Review the deployment history timeline to see logs from recent syncs.  
- Ensure the deployment CLI has permission to write to your certificate paths.  
- If a step fails, rerun the test deployment after addressing the reported error.
