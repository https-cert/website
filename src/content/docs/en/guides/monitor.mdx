anssl keeps an eye on every domain you manage. Automated checks warn you about expiring certificates, broken chains, or misconfigurations before they cause outages.

## Monitoring at a glance

### Expiry tracking

- **Daily checks** â€” Verify validity windows once per day.  
- **Smart notifications** â€” Send alerts when certificates approach expiry.  
- **Visual timeline** â€” See remaining days for every certificate in one dashboard.

### Health auditing

Each run validates critical health signals:

- âœ… Certificate status (valid/expired)  
- âœ… Chain completeness and intermediates  
- âœ… Revocation status  
- âœ… Domain name mapping  
- âœ… Supported signing algorithms  
- âœ… TLS configuration best practices

## Add a domain monitor

<Steps>

1. **Open the monitoring page**

   Navigate to [Domain monitoring](https://anssl.cn/console/monitor).

2. **Create a monitor**

   Click **Add monitor** and provide:

   - Domain or IP address  
   - Port (defaults to 443)

3. **Save**

   anssl runs the first check immediately and schedules recurring jobs automatically.

</Steps>

## Monitoring dashboard

The dashboard surfaces high-level insights and detailed findings.

### Key metrics

- **Total certificates** â€” Count of monitored hosts.  
- **Expiring soon** â€” Certificates with fewer than 30 days remaining.  
- **Expired** â€” Certificates that already lapsed.  
- **Healthy** â€” Certificates passing every check.

### Certificate table

Each tracked domain appears in a sortable table:

| Domain       | Status        | Expires      | Days left | Issuer          | Actions     |
| ------------ | ------------- | ------------ | --------- | --------------- | ----------- |
