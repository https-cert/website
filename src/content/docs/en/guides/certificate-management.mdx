anssl covers every stage of the certificate lifecycle—from issuance and renewal to revocation—so you can manage everything in one console.

## Issue certificates

### Supported certificate types

- **Single-domain** — Protect one hostname (for example `example.com`).  
- **Multi-domain (SAN)** — Secure several distinct hostnames.  
- **Wildcard** — Cover a root domain and all subdomains (for example `*.example.com`).

### Available certificate authorities

- **Let's Encrypt** — Free, automated DV certificates.  
- **ZeroSSL** — Free 90-day certificates with ACME support.  
- **Google Trust Services** — Fast issuance operated by Google.

### Issuance workflow

<Steps>

1. **Log in to the console**

   Visit the [anssl dashboard](https://anssl.cn/console/dashboard) and sign in.

2. **Open Certificates**

   Choose **Certificates** in the left navigation.

3. **Create a certificate**

   Click **New certificate** and provide:

   - Type (single-domain / multi-domain / wildcard)  
   - Domain list  
   - Signing algorithm (ECC P-256 recommended)  
   - Preferred CA

4. **Validate domains**

   Pick the validation method that fits your environment:

   - **DNS** — Add the requested TXT record to your DNS zone.  
   - **HTTP** — (coming soon) Upload the provided token to your site root.

5. **Receive the certificate**

   After successful validation, the CA issues the certificate—usually within a few minutes.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  ECC P-256 offers RSA-3072 levels of security with smaller keys and faster handshakes, so it’s our default recommendation.

## Renew certificates

### Automatic renewals

anssl can renew certificates automatically before they expire:

- Renewal attempts begin 20 days before expiry.  
- The platform retries daily until success.  
- Failures trigger email and webhook notifications.  
- Customize the renewal window to match your operational policies.

### Manual renewals

To renew manually:

1. Open the Certificates page.  
2. Locate the certificate to renew.  
3. Click **Renew**.  
4. anssl repeats the validation and issuance steps automatically.

## Download certificates

When issuance succeeds you can download the assets:

1. Locate the certificate in the inventory.  
2. Click **Download** to retrieve the bundle (certificate, key, and intermediates if applicable).

## Revoke certificates

Revoke a certificate immediately if the private key is compromised or the certificate is no longer required:

1. Open the Certificates page.  
2. Select the relevant certificate.  
3. Click **Revoke**.  
4. Provide the reason for audit tracking.  
5. anssl submits the revocation request to the issuing CA.

<Aside type="danger">
  Revocation is permanent. After revoking, request a new certificate to restore service.
</Aside>

## Troubleshooting

### Issuance failed—what next?

Common causes include:

- DNS records missing or not yet propagated.  
- HTTP validation file inaccessible.  
- Incorrect domain configuration.  
- Hitting CA rate limits.

Fixes:

1. Confirm the validation data matches the instructions.  
2. Wait for DNS propagation (typically 10 minutes to 2 hours).  
3. Review the error details in the certificate activity log for guidance.
