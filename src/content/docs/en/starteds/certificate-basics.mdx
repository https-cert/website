## 1. What is an SSL certificate?

An SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate is a digital credential that enables encrypted communication between a client and a server. It safeguards data in transit, ensuring confidentiality and integrity so information cannot be intercepted or tampered with.

### Why SSL certificates matter

- Encrypt traffic to protect user privacy.  
- Prove website authenticity and block phishing attempts.  
- Improve search-engine ranking signals.  
- Build customer trust with visible security indicators.  
- Meet regulatory and compliance requirements.

### Validation levels

- **DV (Domain Validation)** – Confirms domain ownership; fastest issuance.  
- **OV (Organization Validation)** – Verifies registered business details for extra assurance.  
- **EV (Extended Validation)** – Highest scrutiny; surfaces enhanced identity signals in some browsers.

### Validity periods

- Let's Encrypt: 90 days  
- ZeroSSL: 90 days  
- Commercial CAs: typically 1–3 years

  Expired certificates trigger browser security warnings that damage user trust and SEO performance. Enable monitoring and automatic renewals in anssl so certificates renew before the deadline.

## 2. Signing algorithm essentials

The signing algorithm defines how a certificate’s authenticity is verified. Different algorithms balance security, performance, and compatibility in different ways.

### RSA

- **RSA-2048** – Widely supported with strong security.  
- **RSA-3072** – Higher assurance for stricter policies.  
- **RSA-4096** – Maximum strength, but heavier CPU usage.

### ECDSA (ECC)

- **P-256** – Comparable to RSA-3072 with better performance.  
- **P-384** – Comparable to RSA-7680 for higher security margins.  
- **P-521** – Equivalent strength to RSA-15360, rarely needed outside specialized environments.

### Comparing the algorithms

- **RSA**
  - Pros: Universal compatibility across clients and devices.
  - Cons: Longer keys and signatures increase CPU cost.
- **ECDSA**
  - Pros: Short keys, strong security, and excellent performance.
  - Cons: Older clients may lack full support.

### Selection guidance

- Use **ECC P-256** for most modern workloads.  
- Choose **ECC P-384** or **RSA-3072** for higher-assurance environments.  
- Stick with **RSA-2048** when maximum compatibility is mandatory.  
- Pick ECDSA when low latency and resource efficiency are priorities.  
- anssl defaults to ECC P-256 for new requests.

<Aside type="caution" title="Algorithm safety note">
  Legacy algorithms such as RSA-1024 or MD5-signed certificates are no longer secure. anssl excludes unsafe options so all new certificates meet modern security expectations.
