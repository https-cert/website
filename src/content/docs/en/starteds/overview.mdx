## Feature highlights

### Simple to use

- **Visual dashboard**: Configure every workflow from the web UI—no ACME scripting required.
- **Fast onboarding**: Issue your first certificate in five minutes.
- **Guided flows**: Contextual tips and inline help keep less experienced teammates unblocked.

### Secure and reliable

- **Encrypted storage**: Sensitive data is encrypted at rest.
- **Local key generation**: Private keys are generated in the browser so they never touch our servers.

### Operational efficiency

- **Bulk actions**: Batch issuance, renewals, and deployment keep large fleets manageable.
- **Unified visibility**: View every domain and certificate in one inventory to avoid gaps.
- **End-to-end automation**: Automate the entire lifecycle from issuance to deployment.

### Extensible

- **Multi-CA support**: Issue from different authorities to prevent single points of failure.
- **Multiple algorithms**: Use RSA or ECDSA curves that match your compliance requirements.
- **API access**: Integrate with your provisioning or deployment pipelines using RESTful APIs.

## Common scenarios

### Personal sites

Ship HTTPS quickly for blogs and personal projects to improve trust and SEO.

### Corporate sites

Protect marketing and product sites with trusted certificates that reinforce your brand and user privacy.

### API services

Expose APIs over HTTPS to satisfy client security requirements and avoid blocked requests.

### Non-production environments

Provision certificates for development, staging, and pre-production to mirror production behavior.

### Multi-site operations

Manage certificates for many domains in one place and execute batch changes to stay efficient.

## Supported certificate authorities

- **Let's Encrypt** – The most popular free CA, trusted by every major browser.
- **ZeroSSL** – A free DV CA that complements Let's Encrypt for redundancy.
- **Google Trust Services** – Google-operated CA with fast issuance and high reliability.
- **SSL.com** – Single-domain support for teams that prefer a commercial CA.

## Certificate types

### Single-domain certificates

Protect a single hostname such as `example.com` or `www.example.com`.

**Best for**: One-off sites or services.

### Multi-domain (SAN) certificates

Secure multiple hostnames—`example.com`, `api.example.com`, and `blog.example.com`—with one certificate.

**Best for**: Related services and shared infrastructure.

### Wildcard certificates

Cover an entire namespace such as `*.example.com`, including `www.example.com` and `api.example.com`.

**Best for**: Environments with many dynamic subdomains.

## Supported algorithms

### ECDSA (recommended)

- **ECC P-256** – Great balance of performance and security; comparable to RSA-3072.
- **ECC P-384** – Higher security comparable to RSA-7680.

### RSA

- **RSA-2048** – Broadest compatibility, ideal when supporting legacy clients.
- **RSA-3072** – Higher security for stricter environments.
- **RSA-4096** – Maximum cryptographic strength with higher performance cost.
