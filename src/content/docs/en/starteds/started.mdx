Welcome to anssl! This guide walks you through creating your account and issuing your first free SSL certificate in about five minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, confirm you have:

- ‚úÖ A valid email address
- ‚úÖ A registered domain name
- ‚úÖ DNS management permissions for the domain (required for ownership validation)

<Aside type="tip">
  Need a domain? Register one through your preferred provider (for example, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, GoDaddy).
</Aside>

## Step 1: Create an account

<Steps>

1. **Open the registration page**

   Visit the [anssl registration form](https://anssl.cn/register).

2. **Enter your details**

   - Email address  
   - Password (minimum 8 characters with letters and numbers)  
   - Password confirmation

3. **Submit the form**

   Click **Register**. A verification email arrives within a few seconds.

4. **Verify your email**

   Open the email and follow the verification link to activate your account.

</Steps>

## Step 2: Sign in to the console

After verification:

1. Navigate to the [login page](https://anssl.cn/login).  
2. Enter the email and password you just created.  
3. Click **Log in** to reach the dashboard.

First-time users see a welcome screen with shortcuts to common tasks.

## Step 3: Request a free certificate

<Steps>

1. **Open Certificate Management**

   In the left navigation, choose **Certificates** to view your inventory.

2. **Start a new request**

   Click **New certificate** in the top-right corner.

3. **Pick a certificate type**

   Choose the option that fits your scenario:

   - **Single-domain**: Protects one hostname (for example `example.com`).  
   - **Wildcard**: Covers a root domain and all subdomains (for example `*.example.com`).  
   - **Multi-domain (SAN)**: Secures multiple unique hostnames under one certificate.

4. **Enter domain details**

   - Provide the primary domain you want to secure.  
   - For wildcard certificates, use the `*.domain.com` format.

5. **Select a certificate authority**

   We recommend:

   - **Let's Encrypt** ‚Äì Well-known, fast issuance.  
   - **ZeroSSL** ‚Äì Free alternative for redundancy.  
   - **Google Trust Services** ‚Äì Fast issuance backed by Google.

6. **Pick a signing algorithm**

   - Use **ECC P-256** for the best blend of performance and security.  
   - If you must support legacy platforms, choose **RSA-2048**.

7. **Choose a validation method**

   anssl supports multiple validation flows:

   **DNS verification** (recommended):

   - Add the requested TXT record to your DNS provider.  
   - Works for every certificate type, including wildcards.

   **HTTP verification** (coming soon):

   - Upload the provided challenge file to your site root.  
   - Ideal for domains already serving content.  
   - Not supported for wildcard certificates.

8. **Complete domain validation**

9. **Wait for issuance**

   Once validation succeeds, the CA issues the certificate‚Äînormally within one to five minutes.

10. **Download your files**

    When the status shows **Issued**, click **Download** to retrieve the certificate bundle.

</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  DNS propagation can take 5‚Äì30 minutes. If validation fails, wait a bit and try again after confirming the record resolves.
</Aside>

## Step 4: Deploy the certificate

### Option A: Manual deployment

After downloading the certificate files, deploy them based on your server stack.

#### Nginx

1. Upload the certificate and key:

```bash
scp example.com.pem root@your-server:/etc/nginx/ssl/
scp example.com.key root@your-server:/etc/nginx/ssl/
```

2. Update the virtual host configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name example.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/example.com.key;

    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
    ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

    # additional directives‚Ä¶
}
```

3. Test and reload Nginx:

```bash
nginx -t
nginx -s reload
```

#### Apache

1. Upload the certificate and private key:

```bash
scp example.com.crt root@your-server:/etc/ssl/certs/
scp example.com.key root@your-server:/etc/ssl/private/
```

2. Edit the virtual host:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName example.com

    SSLEngine on
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/example.com.crt
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/example.com.key

    # additional directives‚Ä¶
</VirtualHost>
```

3. Restart Apache:

```bash
systemctl restart apache2
```

### Option B: Automatic deployment

anssl can deploy certificates for you on a schedule:

1. Open **Automatic Deployment** in the console.  
2. Select the certificate you just issued.  
3. Configure deployment targets (server credentials or cloud provider tokens).  
4. Run a deployment test to confirm connectivity.  
5. Enable automatic deployment to sync changes after each renewal.

See the [deployment guide](/en/guides/deploy) for detailed configuration steps.

## Step 5: Verify the certificate

Confirm that the certificate is active and trusted:

1. **Check in a browser**

   Visit `https://yourdomain.com` and confirm:

   - The address bar shows a lock icon üîí.  
   - No security warnings appear.  
   - The certificate details match your domain.

2. **Run an online scan**

   Use [SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/):

   - Visit the test page.  
   - Enter your domain name.  
   - Review the grade and remediation tips.

3. **Validate via CLI**

   ```bash
   openssl s_client -connect example.com:443 -servername example.com
   ```

<Aside type="tip">
  A `Verify return code: 0 (ok)` message indicates the certificate chain is valid.

## Frequently asked questions

### What if domain validation fails?

**DNS validation**:

- Double-check the requested TXT or CNAME record value.  
- Allow 5‚Äì30 minutes for propagation.  
- Use `nslookup` or `dig` to confirm the record is visible publicly.

**HTTP validation**:

- Ensure the challenge file is publicly accessible over HTTP.  
- Review firewall/CDN rules that might block the request.  
- Temporarily disable forced HTTP‚ÜíHTTPS redirects if necessary.

### Why does the browser still show ‚ÄúNot Secure‚Äù?

Potential causes:

- Incorrect certificate path in your server configuration.  
- Mismatch between the private key and certificate.  
- Missing intermediate certificates.  
- Browser cache holding an earlier state.

Fixes:

1. Review the server configuration for path typos.  
2. Run the SSL Labs scan to identify chain issues.  
3. Clear the browser cache and reload.

### How do I request a wildcard certificate?

Wildcard certificates require DNS validation:

1. Enter the domain as `*.example.com`.  
2. Choose the DNS validation option.  
3. Add the provided TXT/CNAME record.  
4. Complete validation to receive the certificate.

### How do free and paid certificates differ?

| Feature          | Free certificates | Paid certificates |
| ---------------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Encryption level | Same              | Same              |
| Browser trust    | Same              | Same              |
| Validity period  | 90 days           | 1‚Äì3 years         |
| Validation types | DV only           | DV / OV / EV      |
| Support          | Community         | Dedicated support |
| Warranty         | None              | Included on many plans |

Free DV certificates cover most personal and SMB use cases. Enterprises with compliance requirements often select OV or EV offerings from commercial CAs.
